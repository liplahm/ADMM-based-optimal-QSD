This repository contains the final report for the term paper on ADMM-based optimal quantum state discrimination (QSD).

The work applies the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to the problem of optimal quantum state discrimination, which can be formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem for general non-orthogonal quantum states.

Compared to standard SDP solvers used in the literature, the proposed approach achieves a significant reduction in computational time while maintaining accuracy up to two decimal places.
