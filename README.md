This is the final report for the work done in term paper for admm based optimal qsd.
Here we applied the admm algorithm to the problem of optimal Quantum State Discrimination which is a SDP problem for general non orthogonal states. The time complexity is considerably reduced for accuracy within two decimal places wrt the SDP algorithm in literature.
